     <h4>Act IV-, SCENE III- HARPAGON, CLÃ‰ANTE, _The scene is at_ PARIS, _in_ HARPAGON'S _house_.</h5>
     <P>

        <h5 class= "name HAR">HAR.</h5> <p class="speech"> Well, now, all consideration of stepmother aside, tell me what do you think of this lady?</p>

        <h5 class="name CLE">CLE.</h5> <p class="speech"> What I think of her?</p>

        <h5 class="name HAR">HAR.</h5> <p class="speech"> Yes, what do you think of her appearance, her figure, her beauty and intelligence?</p>

        <h5 class="name CLE">CLE.</h5> <p class="speech"> So, so.</p>

        <h5 class="name HAR">HAR.</h5> <p class="speech">But still?</p>

        <h5 class="name CLE">CLE.</h5> <p class="speech"> To tell you the truth, I did not find her such as I expected. Her
             manner is that of a thorough coquette, her figure is rather awkward,
             her beauty very middling, and her intelligence of the meanest order.
             Do not suppose that I say this to make you dislike her; for if I must
             have a stepmother, I like the idea of this one as well as of any other.</p>

        <h5 class="name HAR">HAR.</h5> <p class="stagedirection">[You spoke to her just now]</p> <p class="speech"> nevertheless....</p>

        <h5 class="name CLE">CLE.</h5> <p class="speech"> I paid her several compliments in your name, but it was to please you.</p>

        <h5 class="name HAR">HAR.</h5> <p class="speech"> So then you don't care for her?</p>

        <h5 class="name CLE">CLE.</h5> <p class="stagedirection">[Who?  I?]</p><p class="speech"> Not in the least.</p>

        <h5 class="name HAR">HAR.</h5> <p class="speech"> I am sorry for it, for that puts an end to a scheme which had
             occurred to me. Since I have seen her here, I have been thinking of my
             own age; and I feel that people would find fault with me for marrying
             so young a girl. This consideration had made me determine to abandon
             the project, and as I had demanded her in marriage, and had given her
             my promise, I would have given her to you if it were not for the
             dislike you have for her.</p>

        <h5 class="name CLE">CLE.</h5> <p class="speech"> To me?</p>

        <h5 class="name HAR">HAR</h5> <p class="speech"> To you.</p>

        <h5 class="name CLE">CLE.</h5> <p class="speech"> In marriage?</p>

        <h5 class="name HAR">HAR.</h5> <p class="speech"> In marriage.</p>

     </P>
