        HAR. Well, now, all consideration of stepmother aside, tell me what do you think of this lady?

        CLE. What I think of her?

        HAR. Yes, what do you think of her appearance, her figure, her beauty and intelligence?

        CLE. So, so.

        HAR. But still?

        CLE. To tell you the truth, I did not find her such as I expected. Her
             manner is that of a thorough coquette, her figure is rather awkward,
             her beauty very middling, and her intelligence of the meanest order.
             Do not suppose that I say this to make you dislike her; for if I must
             have a stepmother, I like the idea of this one as well as of any other.

        HAR. You spoke to her just now, nevertheless....

        CLE. I paid her several compliments in your name, but it was to please you.

        HAR. So then you don't care for her?

        CLE. Who? I? Not in the least.

        HAR. I am sorry for it, for that puts an end to a scheme which had
             occurred to me. Since I have seen her here, I have been thinking of my
             own age; and I feel that people would find fault with me for marrying
             so young a girl. This consideration had made me determine to abandon
             the project, and as I had demanded her in marriage, and had given her
             my promise, I would have given her to you if it were not for the
             dislike you have for her.

        CLE. To me?

        HAR. To you. 

        CLE. In marriage?

        HAR. In marriage.

     </P>
