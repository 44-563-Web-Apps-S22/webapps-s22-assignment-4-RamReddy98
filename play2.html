        <h3>The Miser</h4>
        <h4>Act IV-, SCENE IV- HARPAGON, CLÉANTE, MASTER JACQUES. _The scene is at_ PARIS, _in_ HARPAGON'S _house_.</h5>
        <P>

            <h5 class="name JAC">JAC.</h5> <p class="speech"> Hold! hold! Gentlemen, what does this mean? What are you thinking of?</P>

            <h5 class="name CLE">CLE.</h5> <p class="speech"> I don't care a bit for it.</p>

            <h5 class="name JAC">JAC.</h5> <p class="speech"> (_to_ CLÉANTE). Ah! Sir, gently.</p>

            <h5 class="name HAR">HAR.</h5> <p class="speech"> He dares to speak to me with such impudence as that!</p>

            <h5 class="name JAC">JAC.</h5> <p class="speech"> (_to_ HARPAGON). Ah! Sir, I beg of you.</p>

            <h5 class="name CLE">CLE.</h5> <p class="speech"> I shall keep to it.</p> 

            <h5 class="name JAC">JAC.</h5> <p class="stagedirection"> [to_ CLÉANTE]</p> <p class="speech">What! to your father?</p>

            <h5 class="name HAR">HAR.</h5> <p class="speech"> Let me do it.</p>

            <h5 class="name JAC">JAC.</h5> <p class="stagedirection"> [_to_ HARPAGON]</p> <p class="speech"> What! to your son? To me it's different.</p>

            <h5 class="name HAR">HAR.</h5> <p class="speech"> I will make you judge between us, Master Jacques, so that you may see that I have right on my side.</p>

            <h5 class="name JAC">JAC.</h5> <p class="stagedirection"> [Willingly]</p> <p class="speech"> (_To_ CLÉANTE) Go a little farther back.</p>

            <h5 class="name HAR">HAR.</h5> <p class="speech"> There is a young girl I love and want to marry, and the scoundrel has the impudence to love her also, and wants to marry her in spite of me.</p>

            <h5 class="name JAC">JAC.</h5> <p class="speech"> Oh! he is wrong.</p>

            <h5 class="name HAR">HAR.</h5> <p class="speech">Is it not an abominable thing to see a son who does not shrink
                from becoming the rival of his father? And is it not his bounden duty
                to refrain from interfering with my love?</p>

            <h5 class="name JAC">JAC.</h5> <p class="speech"> You are quite right; stop here, and let me go and speak to him.</p>

            <h5 class="name CLE">CLE.</h5> <p class="stagedirection"> [_to_ MASTER JACQUES, _who comes near him_]</p> <p class="speech"> Very well; if he
                wants to make you a judge between us, I have no objection. I care
                little who it is, and I don't mind referring our quarrel to you.</p>

         </P>
